# Silver - Exam Style Questions

## Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs? (4 Marks)

A developer uses a high-level language to programming because they use the common English language to make the code more understandable and to speed up to process of writing and debugging programs.


## What is machine code? (1 Mark)

Is an executable binary code produced either by a compiler, interpreter or assembler.


## Give an example of a high-level language? (1 Mark)

They can be Python, Visual Basic, Java, C, C++, SQL and many more. but, like an example there is an image of Python code.

# Gold - Answer the following questions

## Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages? (6 Marks)

1. In the high-level code, the code details how a problem is to be solved rather than giving instructions on how the computer will provide a solution.
2. The low-level languages are much hardest to learn, more time-consuming to code and difficult to debug.
3. High-level languages can be used on variety of different machines; however, they are not as efficient as low-level languages.


## What does a translator do? (2 Marks)

A translator becomes the high-level languages and the assembler codes into a machine code to be running in a CPU.


## Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code? (4 Marks)

The interpreters translate the source code into machine code one command line at time and immediately executes them.
The compilers translate all the source code at the same time to create the compiled code, or the machine code, also known as the object code.


# Platinum - Exam questions

## What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler? (4 Marks)

A compiler is more efficient because translates the whole program and executes faster the compiled programs, also the users don’t need to have a complier installed in their device.


## What is assembly language? (2 Marks)

Is a type of language that uses words called “mnemonics”. In this language the instructions are specific to the hardware being programed because different CPU´s use different programing languages.


## A developer is writing a program.
	a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code? (2 Marks)
		
		The machine code is the code that is executes by the CPU and consists only as binary digits 0’s and 1’s.
		The high-level languages look more like normal human languages.


	b) One type of translator is an interpreter.

		i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code? (1 Mark)

			When the program has been created, it needs to be saved before it can be run.
			So far, the programing language translates the source code into machine code (one command at time, and immediately executes them).
			You must have the interpreter installed on your computer to do this.


		ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code? (1 Mark)

			A different type of translator is the complier, also exists the assembler, they can translate high-level languages into machine code.
